        I was born in Seatle Washington and raised in Oberlin Ohio. I have both my parents, one brother and a dog. My father is a professor at Oberlin College and my mother is the prosecutor of lorain county(the county I live in). My brother is a senior at Weslyan College in Conneticut, he is majoring in film. I love my family a lot, they have all ways supported me in everything I have ever done. And they have taught me to be the person I am now. I have a 7 year old pitbull that we rescued from the streets of our town when he was 5 months old.

        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
